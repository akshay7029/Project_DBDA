# 🔥 Calorie Burn Prediction System

A complete end-to-end project that predicts calories burned during physical activity using Machine Learning, Big Data (Hadoop, PySpark), and interactive dashboards.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts calories burned based on age, gender, weight, height, duration, and heart rate.
- Uses **Linear Regression** from scikit-learn for model building.
- Integrated **Big Data tools**: stored `.csv` data in **HDFS**, processed with **PySpark DataFrames** and **Spark SQL**.
- GUI built with **Tkinter** for real-time calorie estimation.
- Dashboards created in **Tableau** to explore trends and relationships visually.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- PySpark, Spark SQL, Hadoop HDFS
- Tableau, Tkinter
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Outputs
- Prediction metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Visualizations: average calories by age/gender, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots

## 🚀 Future Work
- Integrate real-time data from smart devices
- Use advanced ML models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Deploy GUI as web/mobile app
